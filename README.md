# ObjectTrackingRobot-OpenCV

In this project, an object of a certain color is processed in real time using image processing methods. Then, the movement of the motors and the progress of the robot are provided through the processed image. The object tracking robot project is a two-stage project with both software and hardware. In the software part, Pyhton and its image processing library OpenCv are used as language. Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi camera modules are used in this project since it will be a mobile platform. In the hardware part, a robot body is used to provide the movement, 2 L293D motor drivers and DC motors to move the wheels, and a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is used on the front of the robot to maintain the tracking distance with the object.
